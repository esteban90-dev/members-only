# Members Only

Members Only is the [authentication project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/authentication) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  

This is an application that lists posts from members.  If you are logged in, you can see who wrote the posts, and create your own.  If you aren't logged in, all you can see is the posts themselves, but not who wrote them.
