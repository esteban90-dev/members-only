Members Only is the second part of the [authentication project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/authentication) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  

This is an application that lists posts from members.  Before you log in, all you can see is the posts themselves, and wonder who wrote them.  Once you log in, you can see which members authored which posts, and you can create your own posts.
